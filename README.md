ABSTRACT

Mentoring is a conventional method of communication between a confirmed professional in a society to an
inexperienced member in the sector. Education sector has found mentoring as quite an effective tool since long
back and with the advent of new technologies, comes an idea of online mentoring, which is also referred to as
e-mentoring. Instead of face-to-face meetings, Online Mentoring System (OMS) uses asynchronous, electronic
communications to establish and support the relationship between mentor and the mentee using virtual mode. It
basically focuses on student and faculty relationships. Online Mentoring System is a Client Server model, which
acts as an Interface between Teacher and Student. OMS strives to reduce the workload of students in entering their
details and at the same time enable the Mentors to assess their students more efficiently. E-Mentoring is
fundamentally developed to improve the performance of students by assisting mentors to understand the problems
of students more effectively and easily. To achieve this, mentees can approach the mentors related to any kind of
problem they are facing, and the mentor can concentrate on those who need their guidance. The mentor can also
assign new mentors (mental health mentors / counsellors) to a mentee who is in dire need for one.
